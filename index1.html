        Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated
         in India as Gandhi Jayanti,
         a national holiday, and worldwide
         as the International Day of Nonviolence.
          Gandhi is commonly,
         though not formally, considered the Father of 
         the Nation in India.

    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma 
    Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer,
    anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist,
    who employed nonviolent resistance 
     to lead the successful campaign
     India's independence from British rule, and in turn inspired 
     movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

    <h2>Quotes by Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
    <blockquote>
        Happiness is when what you think, 
        what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
        An eye for eye only ends up making 
        the whole world blind.
        Where there is love there is life.
